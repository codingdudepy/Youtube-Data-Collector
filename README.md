# Youtube-Data-Collector-
ðŸŽ¥A YouTube Data Collector that allows user to collect data on videos and in youtube in general. I used heroku to launch this if you want to use heroku and launch it yourself and modify it install the exact files I have provided within the folder. If your not using heroku you may remove the following files: 
<ul>
  <li>wsgi.py</li>
  <li>Procfile</li>
</ul>

Furthermore if you would like to add updates to the site as it is always in development feel free to submit a pull request of a better version and if it is good I will personally contact you as long as there is some contact information included that I can find and provide you with some sort amount of <b>money</b>. I love helping talented developers and want to see what you guys can build!
